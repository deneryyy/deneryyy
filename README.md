## Daniel Dorofeev AKA Denery
I've been learning Java and its infrastructure since the beginning of 2021. \
Russian is my native lanuage, tho I am fluent in english too.

You can contact me in discord: `@roryne`

P.S.
I also have an [old github account](https://github.com/maestro-denery) I've lost an access to, but stuff I made there is unimportant.
